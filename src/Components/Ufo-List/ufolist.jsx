                        This ship first appears at the conclusion of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) 
                        and is the main setting in the subsequent Star Trek movies which use the original crew. 
                        The ship is ordered "decommissioned" at the end of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991).[6] 
                        As of 2401, it resides at the Starfleet Museum above Athan Prime, appearing in season 3 of Star Trek: Picard (2023). 
                        Non-canon information concerning this ship includes paperwork included with the model kit, 
                        which indicated the ship was mothballed at the Memory Alpha ship museum, 
                        and the Shatnerverse novel The Ashes of Eden (1996),
                        which depicted Enterprise-A's removal from the mothball fleet before being destroyed defending the planet Chal.

                            rather than carrying those loads on board like a traditional freighter.</p>

                            Galactica was launched more than 500 years before the close of the Thousand Yahren War which concluded during the events of the series pilot episode.[1] 
                            It was believed to be the only Battlestar to survive the destruction of the Twelve Colonies, until Battlestar Pegasus briefly reappeared. 
                            The Galactica is commanded by Commander Adama.</p>

                            Willam Weir. It was the largest space faring vessel built up to that point, measuring almost 2200 metres in length. 
                            At its core lies the gravity drive which allows the ship to travel terrific distances in moments by "folding space" and creating a "gateway". 
                            The ship was designed by Dr Weir and built to be able to travel "faster than light".</p>
